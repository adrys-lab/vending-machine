************Requirements************
- JDK 1.8
- Maven

************Build************
The project is a Maven project.
Build With Maven:
  For build the jar artifact, go to the project path and open a terminal console executing:
  - for package and create jar artifact: 'mvn package' -> jar will be created at target root path.


************Test************
With Maven:
- 'mvn test' -> Tests will be executed under maven context.

With IDE:
- Just go to '<project_folder>/vending-machine/src/test/java/com/dexma/adrian/rebollo/controller/vending' and run all tests.

--> Normally I would tend to implement More Unit Testing with a minnimum of 70-75% or coverage (but I had not much more time).


************Solution************
- Solution is testable via Tests.
