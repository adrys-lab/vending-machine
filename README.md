We want you to solve the following problem, in Java: 

You need to design a Vending Machine which
- Accepts coins of 0.05€, 0.10€, 0.20€, 0.50€, 1€, 2€ 
- Allow user to select products Coke(1.50€), Sprite(1.45€), Water(0.90€) 
- Allow user to take refund by canceling the request.
- Return selected product and remaining change if any
- Allow reset operation for vending machine supplier.

Constraints: 
- the use of databases is not allowed. Save the state in memory.
- use the minimum number of external libraries (except for testing libraries, use as many as you usually do)

Hints:
- We want you to write a module that is framework-agnostic and that can maintain the state. 
- Expose clearly the methods that provide the functionality, but there is no need to write a UI nor a CLI.
- The aim of the test is to evaluate your ability to design a module that: it is easy to understand, test, reuse, evolve and maintain. 

If you have any question you are free to ask, I will try to reply ASAP.
